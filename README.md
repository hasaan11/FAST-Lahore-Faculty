# FAST-Lahore-Faculty
A script that scrapes the data of the faculty at FAST-NUCES Lahore and provides output in the form of an excel sheet

The script outputs 11 files.
As there are 5 departments at FAST currently, there are 5 files(cs.csv, fsm.csv etc) for each department that have (ID, name, designation, HEC Approved PHD Supervisor, Email, Department, Image URL). Furthermore, 5 further files are also there that contain ID, Extension and Latest Education. (fsm_2.csv etc.)

Lastly, there is an output file that combines all 10 files together.

This was done as a part of Assignment for the course Data Science. To see the data of all faculty members, check out the fast_lhr_faculty.csv in the Output folder.
